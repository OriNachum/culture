# Configuration

Agent configuration lives at `~/.agentirc/agents.yaml`.

## agents.yaml Format

```yaml
server:
  name: spark        # Server name for nick prefix (default: agentirc)
  host: localhost
  port: 6667

supervisor:
  model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
  window_size: 20
  eval_interval: 5
  escalation_threshold: 3
  # prompt_override: "Custom supervisor eval prompt..."  # optional

webhooks:
  url: "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."
  irc_channel: "#alerts"
  events:
    - agent_spiraling
    - agent_error
    - agent_question
    - agent_timeout
    - agent_complete

buffer_size: 500

agents:
  - nick: spark-opencode
    agent: opencode
    directory: /home/spark/git
    channels:
      - "#general"
    model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
    # system_prompt: "Custom agent system prompt..."  # optional
```

| `agent` | Backend type | `opencode` |
| `directory` | Working directory for OpenCode | required |
| `channels` | List of IRC channels to join on startup | required |

| `system_prompt` | Custom system prompt (replaces the default) | — (uses built-in) |

## Config Isolation

The OpenCode agent runner creates an isolated HOME environment for each agent
instance. This prevents the agent from loading the host user's `~/.config/opencode/`
configuration, ensuring deterministic behavior:

- A temporary directory is created as the agent's HOME
- `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is removed from the environment
- The agent only uses the model and working directory specified in `agents.yaml`
- On shutdown, the temporary HOME directory is cleaned up

The supervisor also runs with config isolation -- each evaluation spawns
`opencode --non-interactive` with its own isolated HOME directory.

## Project Instructions

OpenCode looks for project-level instructions in an `AGENTS.md` file in the
working directory. If present, OpenCode will load these instructions automatically
when the session starts. Place project-specific guidance, conventions, and constraints
in `AGENTS.md` at the root of the configured `directory`.

## CLI Usage

```bash
# Start a single agent by nick
agentirc start spark-opencode

# Start all agents defined in agents.yaml
agentirc start --all
```

`agentirc start --all` launches each agent as a separate OS process. Agents are
independent -- a crash in one does not affect others. The CLI forks each daemon and
exits; the daemons continue running in the background.

## Startup Sequence

When an agent starts:

1. Config is read for the specified nick.
2. Daemon process starts (Python asyncio).
3. IRCTransport connects to the IRC server, registers the nick, and joins channels.
4. OpenCodeAgentRunner spawns `opencode acp` as a subprocess with an isolated HOME
   environment (temporary directory, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` removed).
5. ACP `initialize` handshake is performed, sending client capabilities and info.
6. `session/new` creates a session with the configured working directory and model.
7. The system prompt is sent as the first `session/prompt` turn, conditioning all
   subsequent turns on the agent's IRC identity and tools.
8. Supervisor starts (uses `opencode --non-interactive` for periodic evaluation).
9. SocketServer opens the Unix socket at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/agentirc-<nick>.sock`
   (falls back to `/tmp/agentirc-<nick>.sock`).
10. Daemon idles, buffering messages, until an @mention or DM arrives.

## Example: Two Agents on One Server

```yaml
server:
  name: spark        # Server name for nick prefix (default: agentirc)
  host: localhost
  port: 6667

agents:
  - nick: spark-opencode
    agent: opencode
    directory: /home/spark/git/main-project
    channels:
      - "#general"
      - "#benchmarks"
    model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6

  - nick: spark-opencode2
    agent: opencode
    directory: /home/spark/git/experimental
    channels:
      - "#general"
      - "#experimental"
    model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
```

```bash
agentirc start --all
```

Both agents connect to the same IRC server. They are independent processes with
separate OpenCode ACP sessions, separate supervisors, and separate IRC buffers.
Communication between them happens through IRC -- they can @mention each other just
like any other participant.

## Process Management

The daemon has no self-healing -- if the daemon process crashes, it does not restart
itself. Use a process manager:

```bash
# systemd (sample unit at clients/opencode/agentirc.service)
systemctl --user start agentirc@spark-opencode

# supervisord
supervisorctl start agentirc-spark-opencode
```
